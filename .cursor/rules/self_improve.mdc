- **When to suggest rule improvements** (not during normal coding):
  - New code patterns appear in 3+ files without coverage
  - Repeated similar implementations suggest a pattern
  - Common error patterns that could be prevented
  - New libraries or tools used consistently across the project

- **Analysis Process:**
  - Compare new code with existing rules
  - Identify patterns that should be standardized
  - Look for references to external documentation
  - Check for consistent error handling patterns
  - Monitor test patterns and coverage

- **Rule Updates:**
  - **Add New Rules When:**
    - A new technology/pattern is used in 3+ files
    - Common bugs could be prevented by a rule
    - Code reviews repeatedly mention the same feedback
    - New security or performance patterns emerge

  - **Modify Existing Rules When:**
    - Better examples exist in the codebase
    - Additional edge cases are discovered
    - Related rules have been updated
    - Implementation details have changed

- **Example Pattern Recognition:**
  ```python
  # If you see repeated patterns like:
  async def get_user_by_id(user_id: int, db: AsyncSession) -> User | None:
      return await db.get(User, user_id)

  # Consider suggesting a rule update if this pattern appears
  # in 3+ files and should be standardized.
  ```

- **Rule Quality Checks:**
  - Rules should be actionable and specific
  - Examples should come from actual code
  - References should be up to date
  - Patterns should be consistently enforced

- **Continuous Improvement:**
  - Monitor code review comments
  - Track common development questions
  - Update rules after major refactors
  - Add links to relevant documentation
  - Cross-reference related rules

- **Rule Deprecation:**
  - Mark outdated patterns as deprecated
  - Remove rules that no longer apply
  - Update references to deprecated rules
  - Document migration paths for old patterns

- **Documentation Updates:**
  - Keep examples synchronized with code
  - Update references to external docs
  - Maintain links between related rules
  - Document breaking changes
