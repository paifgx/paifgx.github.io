- **Prefer existing project patterns** over introducing new styles or abstractions.
- **Keep functions small and single-purpose** (typically ≤30 lines).
- **Avoid clever tricks**; prioritize readability and obvious control flow.
- **Refactor opportunistically** when touching code; leave it cleaner than you found it.

See [engineering-principles.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/engineering-principles.mdc) for KISS and SOLID guidelines.
