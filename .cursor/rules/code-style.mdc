- Write code that is readable, understandable, and maintainable for future readers.
- Aim to create software that is not only functional but also readable, maintainable, and efficient throughout its lifecycle.
- Prioritize clarity to make reading, understanding, and modifying code easier.
- Adhere to established coding standards and write well-structured code to reduce errors.
- Regularly review and refactor code to improve structure, readability, and maintainability. Always leave the codebase cleaner than you found it.
- Code should not need comments at his best. If you add comments then only to describe the "WHY" of the code, never the "WHAT" or "HOW".
